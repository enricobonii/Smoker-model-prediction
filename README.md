# Machine Learning Final Project

This project focuses on detecting smoking status using machine learning techniques. After performing essential preprocessing steps like data scaling and cleaning, various classification models were built and tested, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Decision Trees. The models were fine-tuned using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization techniques such as GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. Performance metrics like ROC AUC, precision, and recall were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The project leverages visualization tools like Seaborn and Plotly to explore data patterns and model results, providing clear insights into the smoking detection task.
