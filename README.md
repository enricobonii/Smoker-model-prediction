# Machine Learning Final Project

In this project, we worked on detecting smoking status using several machine learning models. After cleaning and scaling the data, we trained models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests. We used cross-validation and fine-tuned the models with tools like GridSearchCV to find the best performance. The models were evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and ROC AUC to ensure accuracy. Throughout the project, we also visualized the data and results using Seaborn and Plotly, helping us gain a clearer understanding of the smoking detection task.
